function [GlottalSource] = CCD_GlottalFlowEstimation(wave,Fs,gci,f0,VUVDecisions)

% USAGE:
% [GlottalSource] = CCD_GlottalFlowEstimation(wave,Fs,gci,f0,VUVDecisions)
% 
% INPUTS:
%     - wave is the speech signal
%     - Fs is the sampling frequency (Hz)
%     - gci are the Glottal Closure Instant locations (in samples)
%     - f0 is the vector of F0 values (with an hopsize of 10ms)
%     - VUVDecisions is the vector of voiced-unvoiced VUVDecisions (with an hopsize of 10ms)
%    
% OUPUT:
%     - GlottalSource is a signal containing the derivative of the
%     glottal flow only for voiced glottal cycles
%
